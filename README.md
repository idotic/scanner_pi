# Pi 3d scanner
Well, it talks by itself.  I will be using motor taken from printer and traditionnal scanners.

I will be using also the PiCamera for the moment and L298N, with a recycled control board taken also from a printer.

Pictures might be stored on a usb key.

Eventually, if it is possible with Pi, I will also integrate photogrammetry program to "compile" the 3d object from the pictures.
